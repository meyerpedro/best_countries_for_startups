## 1. How To
This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file with the code used to manipulate the datasets. The Feature Engineering was done with the Pandas Library.<br>
This read me also contains the link for the dashboards created on Tableau. It redirects the user to the Tableau Public website.
To open the jupyter notebook file, go to folder in terminal and type 

    
    & jupyter notebook

## 3. Exploratory Analysis

After cleaning and arranging the dataset, the data was ready for the exploration analysis. The first question was what countries were the best ranked in hosting Start Up companies. The United States stands out as a outlier. Within the cities, San Francisco has the highest score, with over 219 points from the second place. The average score for high income countries is aproximately 52 points higher than the second highest average, however, by excluding the United States, that difference is only of aproximately 8 points. Something to take in consideration is that there are only 100 countries represented in the dataset and they are mostly high income countries.<p>

## 4. Analysis 
By looking at the current ranking, an interesting question is to find out if the same countries that hold high positions in the ranking are also the ones that have been improving in the ranking the most.<p>
As shown on Dashboard 2, countries that were higher in the ranking are not necessarily the ones that improved the most. The United Arab Emirates improved the most, however they are only 22nd in the ranking. Other countries like Arzebaijan lost many positions in the ranking.

## 5. Actionable Items
Many investiment opportunities can be found in countries who are consistently improving their environment to start ups companies. A thriving industry, well supported by a rich infrastructure and laws who incentivize small business drives investments. In the analysis, we can see which countries have been improving, and thus, becoming a hypothetically safer destination for investments. <p>
Another way to use the information provided on the dashboards is to spot places that are creating positive changes in their industries to accomodate smaller businesses and study what those changes are. Those can be duplicated in different markets and thus improving the business enviroments' health. Since high income countries have a better enviroment for start ups, it is a good hypothesis that financial investment is important, but where are those investments being made and how in what amount? The data on dashboard 2 tells us where to look for those answers.
